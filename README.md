## Files


### Component Standards
A component JSX file always needs to be organized in various Sections, each Section marked at the beginning with a comment, and a two-line spacing between each Section:


```JSX
Packages
Imports
Constants
Components
Redux
Variables
Styles
Functions
PropTypes
Exports
```
